# CS4082 - Lab 2 (KNN on Iris Dataset)

## Overview
This lab applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset.

## Steps Done
- Loaded the Iris dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
- Trained KNN model (k=3)
- Evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Tested multiple k values (1 to 15) and selected the best k
- Plotted accuracy vs k

## Files
- `Lab2 ML Sklearn.ipynb` : Google Colab notebook containing code, outputs, and conclusion.

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells in order.
